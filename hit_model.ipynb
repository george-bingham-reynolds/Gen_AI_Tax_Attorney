    "ask(\"Our company is a software company with its primary offering being an online data aggregation platform. Users can issue their employees various proprietary surveys, which gauge such employees' satisfaction with their workplace environment. The platform aggregates and displays the responses through easy-to-read visual aides (such as a 1-100 ranged score). We know that software companies often qualify as 'qualified small businesses' under Section 1202, which allows for a nearly unlimited exclusion of capital gain on stock (qualified small business stock or 'QSBS') in the company. However, separate counsel has told us that a 'consulting' business may be excluded under Section 1202(e)(3). Our online platform provides general 'best practices' for certain ranges of survey responses, but does not tailor any of such advice for individual clients. Would we be disqualified as a consulting business for purposes of Section 1202/QSBS?\", k=2)\n",
